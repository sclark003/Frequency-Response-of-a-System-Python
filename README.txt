To calculate the frequency response of such a system:
1. Take a position on the unit circle (where magnitude = 1) corresponding to the frequency of the input signal. Construct vectors from each pole to that position. 
2. Calculate the vector product of these vectors, producing the result P 
3. Repeat the procedure for for the zeros yeilding Z. Remember that to make a causal system, you probably ended up with zeros at the origin. 
4. The frequency response is the result of the vector division of Z by P
